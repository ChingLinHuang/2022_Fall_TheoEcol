[["index.html", "Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Course information", " Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Instructor: Po-Ju Ke \\(~~~~~\\) Teaching Assistant: Ching-Lin Huang (Andy) 2022 Fall at National Taiwan Univeristy Course information Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in ecology, starting from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multi-species models. The course will primarily focus on population and community ecology, but we will also briefly discuss models in epidemiology and ecosystem ecology. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture followed by a one-hour hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and derive general theories in ecology. In the hands-on practice section, we will use a combination of analytical problem sets, interactive applications, and numerical simulations to gain a general understanding of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objective By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirement Students are expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. Format Tuesday 6,7,8 (1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm) at 共207 Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will be using a combination of textbooks and literature articles on theoretical ecology in this course.

Part 3 - In-class exercise: Analyzing population matrix of common teasel Common teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris) is a herbaceous plant commonly found in abandoned fields and meadows in North America. It has a complex life cycle consisting of various stages. The seeds may lie dormant for one or two years. Seeds that germinate form small rosettes, which will gradually transit into medium and eventually large rosettes. These rosettes (all three sizes) may remain in the same stage for years before entering the next stage. After undergoing vernalization, large (and a few medium) rosettes will form stalks and flower in the upcoming summer, set seeds once, and die. Occasionally, the flowering plants will produce seeds that directly germinate into small/medium/large rosettes without entering dormancy. Here is a transition diagram for the teasel. Please convert this diagram into a stage-based transition matrix (Lefkovitch matrix) and derive the asymptotic growth rate \\(\\lambda\\) in R. Part 4 - COM(P)ADRE: A global database of population matrices COM(P)ADRE is an online repository containing matrix population models on hundreds of plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, and viruses around the world, as well as their associated metadata.

"],["week-6---metapopulations-and-patch-occupancy-models.html", "Week 6 - Metapopulations and patch occupancy models", " Week 6 - Metapopulations and patch occupancy models Plants can condition nearby soil microbial communities, which will in turn influence the performance of subsequent colonizing plants. The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination. In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation \\(P_{ij}\\) to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species \\(i\\) but have soil microbes state \\(j\\). Here, as a single species model, \\(i\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant \\(A\\), respectively. Similarly, \\(j\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant \\(A\\), respectively. In summary: \\(P_{00}\\) represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites \\(P_{A0}\\) represents cites colonized by plant \\(A\\) but the soil is yet to be conditioned \\(P_{AA}\\) represents plant \\(A\\) colonizing a site with plant-\\(A\\)-specific microbial community \\(P_{0A}\\) represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant \\(A\\) At the landscape scale, \\(P_{ij}\\) represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, \\(\\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}\\), summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure. Here, \\(P_{00}\\) can be colonized by plant \\(A\\) when propagules arrive (per capita rate \\(r_{A}\\)), transitioning the state from \\(P_{00}\\) to \\(P_{A0}\\). Plants may die, with rate \\(m_{A}\\), before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) back to \\(P_{00}\\)), or may successfully condition the soil with rate \\(c_{A}\\) (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) to \\(P_{AA}\\)). After plants within the state \\(P_{AA}\\) die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as \\(P_{0A}\\). These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from \\(P_{0A}\\) back to \\(P_{AA}\\)) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, \\(\\alpha\\). Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate \\(d_{A}\\), transitioning the state from \\(P_{0A}\\) to \\(P_{00}\\). In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system.

To calculate long-term average, we need to find out the period of the cycle and then calculate the average population size within a period. The period of the cycle may be derived from the distance between peaks in the dynamics shown above, or by some algorithms, e.g. pracma::findpeaks. Part 2: Time-scale separation Time-scale separation is a useful technique to reduce the dimension of the model system, where some state variables are assumed to operate at a much shorter time scale (i.e., fast variables) compared with the others (i.e., slow variables). The fast variables will be attracted rapidly to their new equilibrium in response to a slight change in the slow variables, such that the slow variables can be viewed as “constants” from the perspective of fast variables (and the fast variable will always be at its quasi-equilibrium from the perspective of the slow variable). Here, we are going to use the Lotka-Volterra model with logistic prey growth to demonstrate the time-scale separation technique: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac {dN}{dt} &amp;= rN(1-\\frac{N}{K})-aNP\\\\ \\frac {dP}{dt} &amp;= eaNP-dP \\end{align*}\\] The ZNGIs of \\(N\\) are \\(N = 0\\) and \\(r(1-\\frac{N}{K}) - aP = 0\\) and the ZNGIs of \\(P\\) are \\(P = 0\\) and \\(eaN = d\\) in this model. We treat prey as a fast variable and predator as a slow variable. First, we find the quasi-equilibrium \\(\\widehat{N}\\) of prey by setting the prey equation to zero: \\[\\widehat{N} = K(1-\\frac{aP}{r})\\] And then we plug \\(\\widehat{N}\\) into predator equation: \\[\\frac {dP}{dt} = (eaK-d)P(1-\\frac{eaK(\\frac{a}{r})}{eaK-d}P)\\] One simple way to achieve time-scale separation in this model is to increase the prey growth rate so that prey will grow much faster than predator, mimicking the shorter generation time of prey relative to that of predator. library(deSolve) Prey_logistic_model &lt;- function(times, state, parms) { with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { dN_dt = r*N*(1-(N/K))-a*N*P dP_dt = e*a*N*P-d*P return(list(c(dN_dt, dP_dt))) }) } times &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 0.01) state &lt;- c(N = 40, P = 20) parms &lt;- c(r = 40, K = 60, a = 0.1, e = 0.1, d = 0.5) # r is chosen to be sufficiently large for time-scale separation pop_size &lt;- ode(func = Prey_logistic_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) Under time-scale separation, population of prey rapidly becomes stable and predator exhibits a logistic growth. We show these by the trajectories of \\(P\\) and \\(N\\) over time. # population trajectories plot(c(0, max(times)), c(0, max(pop_size[, c(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;P&quot;)] + 10)), type = &quot;n&quot;, xlab = &quot;time&quot;, ylab = &quot;population size&quot;) lines(N ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;blue&quot;) # dynamics of N lines(P ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;red&quot;) # dynamics of P legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;P&quot;), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), lty = 1) Since \\(N\\) is a fast variable, it will immediately achieve the its ZNGI on the state-space diagram. # state-space diagram plot(c(0, max(pop_size[, &quot;N&quot;])), c(0, max(pop_size[, &quot;P&quot;])), type = &quot;n&quot;, xlab = &quot;N&quot;, ylab = &quot;P&quot;) abline(v = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;) # ZNGI of N abline(a = parms[1]/parms[3], b = -parms[1]/(parms[3]*parms[2]), col = &quot;blue&quot;) # ZNGI of N abline(h = 0, col = &quot;red&quot;) # ZNGI of P abline(v = parms[5]/(parms[4]*parms[3]), col = &quot;red&quot;) # ZNGI of P points(P ~ N, data = pop_size, col = &quot;gray&quot;) Play with the growth rate \\(r\\) from small to large values and see how the trajectory of prey and predator moves along the state-space.
